
// if-else and switch statements are used for conditional situations and loops are used to avoid repetition of a particular block in code.

// Criterion for choosing the correct control flow structure.
// i. if-else and switch : If the condition consists of a comparision statement of only a single variable against a other discrete constants, then switch statement is preferred but using the modern switch case syntax we can also compare a number with a range of numbers but this can only be compiled on modern compilers, otherwise in complex conditional situations where more than one variables are involved in comparision, if-else is the best choice to go with.
// ii. loops : If the demand is to repeat a particular task again and again until a specific condition is met, then it's clear use case of loop.
