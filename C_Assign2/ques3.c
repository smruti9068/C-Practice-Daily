
// Functions of break and continue statements within a loops are to terminate loop completely and to skip the current iteration to next iteration respectively.

// Applications
// i. break -> In a linear search , whenever we find the target element , we use break to avoid unnecessary searches to enhance time complexity.
// ii. continue -> A program which is adding all the numbers from 1 to 100 except those which has '0' in rightmost position, then we can put a continue statement inside the loop before the code for adding numbers. if(num % 10 == 0) {continue;} sum += num
